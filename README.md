Joining an alredy existing project, I collaborated with 1 other programmer, and 2 digital artists, to continue developing the project.
Setting clear goals of wanting to add more levels and expand features, we kept to our timeline by using a Kanban board on the website Trello.
One of 2 programmers, I contributed to the team by uprgrading and expanding the existing project. Using my knowledge of the C# language and the program Unity, I challenged myself to both apply my current knowledge, and learn new ways of overcoming my tasks.
As a result, the project has expanded by 2 levels, gained 4 additional screens, added 2 additional objectives, and implmented 3 other functional features.
