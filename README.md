Featured here is a selection of C# code I created for the project Mayday Mayday: Sundered Crew, in addition to a Gantt Chart.

Joining an already existing project, I collaborated with one other programmer, and two digital artists, to continue developing the project.
Setting clear goals of wanting to add more levels and expand features, we kept to our timeline by using a Kanban board on the website Trello.
One of two programmers, I contributed to the team by uprgrading and expanding the existing project. Using my knowledge of the C# language and the program Unity, I challenged myself to both apply my current knowledge, and learn new ways of overcoming my tasks.
As a result, the project has expanded by 2 levels, gained 4 additional screens, added 2 additional objectives, and implmented 3 other functional features.
